Using docker container to mount on local drive.
To start a Docker container with ENVIRO pre-loaded into it, do:

```bash
docker run -p80:80 -p8765:8765 -v $PWD:/source -it klavins/enviro:v1.61 bash
esm start
```

The above commands do the following:

- The `-p80:80 option maps *port* 80 from the Docker container to ports on your host computer. This should allow you to go to 
    > http://localhost
    with your web browser and see the ENVIRO client. It should say "Error: Failed to fetch. Is the server running?" at this point. 

- The `-p8765:8765` option allows the ENVIRO client to communicate with the `enviro` server (not yet running) via a *WebSocket*.

- The command `esm start` uses the <u>e</u>nviro <u>s</u>etup <u>m</u>anager to start a web server from which your browser can access the ENVRIO client.


Make the project and start the enviro sever as follows.
```bash
make
enviro
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost` you should see a rectangular walled area. 

You can press `Ctrl-C` to stop the enviro server.
